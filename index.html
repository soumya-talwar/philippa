                You are a transplant surgeon, and you have 5 patients in critical need of an organ each. One needs a liver, two need a kidney, one a heart, another a lung. There are no donors. But there is a healthy patient in the next room. Which is the more ethical course of action?

            </div>
            <p>Philippa has been trained on people's responses to moral dilemmas that pit 5 lives against 1. But despite the five situations bearing the same conflict between their consequences, our moral intuition will tell us that they are all inherently different from one another. That is because there are more moral variables at play than just the number of lives.<br><br>
              A machine understands arithmatic comparisions. 5 will always be greater than 1, yet Philippa works on a framework that accounts for other moral variables like: desire, intent, and duty.<br><br>
              For example: it is one thing to steer a trolley towards someone foreseeing that you will kill them. But it is something entirely different if their death is a purposeful part of your plan. In the first thought experiment, there’s no certainty that the worker will die. It is possible that they may find a foothold in the tunnel to cling onto until the trolley passes. The driver will not jump out of the trolley to kill the worker. Whereas when you're a surgeon in the second thought experiment, you need the death of the healthy individual for your purposes. The person’s death is necessary for you to save the five patients. This is the distinction between direct and oblique intent.<br><br>
              Another distinction to be made is between our duties: negative duties and positive duties. Negative duties can be thought of as our obligation to refrain from killing or robbing other people. Examples of positive duties can include out duty to look after our children, the aged, etc.<br><br>
              In the first situation, as the trolley driver you face a conflict of negative duties— the duty to avoid injuring five people or the duty to avoid injuring one. But in the case where you are the doctor who can save five patients by manufacturing a gas that can kill another patient, the death of the one patient is not directly intended. Even then a lot of us wouldn’t find it morally permissible to kill the singular patient because even if the death is obliquely intended, our negative duty to not cause injury overrules our positive duty to aid.<br><br>
              Philippa operates on moral variables like these, and the five moral dilemmas are simply combinations of the different states of these variables. For a more detailed reading on the different schools of thought and ethical systems that influenced Philippa's creation, you may read <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tZf7E-1D83kdRtvcTYv1zmtPzAr9_o06/view?usp=sharing">this research paper</a>.

              The problem that arises in works such as these is that humans cannot objectively convey morality in a quantifiable manner to a machine. Furthermore, there’s no general consensus about which moral reasoning to teach human beings, let alone machines.<br><br>
              This is why people's moral stances were crowdsourced and then taught to the machine. The dataset is very small at this point, but with more responses, the results will most likely gain more accuracy.
